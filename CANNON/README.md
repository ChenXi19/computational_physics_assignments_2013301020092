# Assignment_6: The Trajectory of a Cannon Shell
student name: Chen Xi  student number: 2013301020092

## Abstruct 
In this assignment, we are required to solve for the solution of the trajectory of a cannon shell. To be specific, a projectile is considered as a shell shot by a cannon. And the discussion is carried out under different conditions-a. with or without drag force and b. different ways to estimate the drag force.Factors concerning this assignment are listed as:<br>
* Euler method <br>
The Euler method is what we use to solve for the solution.
* Drag force of air <br>
A comparison between the plots under different conditions-with or without drag force-was made, taking into account the speed, angle and the maximum cannon-shot.
* The influence of the air density on the drag force<br>
A correction to the drag force is made in this section using different approaches. Two approches are used seperately, which are:
  * Isothermal: The air is considered as an ideal gas with a constant temperature.
  * Adiabatic: The air is assumed as a poor conductor with very slow or no convection.
