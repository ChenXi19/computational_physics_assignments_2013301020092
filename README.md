>Since it is the first time that I get in touch with computer in a real sense, I imagine it is going to be really hard.
And I hope that after this semester I can be a little bit better at using my computer rather than simply use it to watch films. 
So that is the plan and good luck with myself.<br>


>And in the last, I'd like to thank CaoYi for helping me creat my assignments page.
## [Assignment_2](https://github.com/ChenXi19/hello-world/blob/master/README.md)
Since there is no requirements for the first homework, I just tried out some ways to put down things.And things are far
more interesting than I thought.
## [Assignment_3](https://github.com/ChenXi19/assignment2/blob/master/README.md)
## [Assignment_4 and Assignment_5](https://github.com/ChenXi19/Assignment3)
Since both assignment_4 and assignment_5 require to practice Python using problems in Chapter one, I used two problems as examples to discuss factors, contributing errors in Euler method.
