>Since it is the first time that I get in touch with computer in a real sense, I imagine it is going to be really hard.
And I hope that after this semester I can be a little bit better at using my computer rather than simply use it to watch films. 
So that is the plan and good luck with myself.<br>


>And in the last, I'd like to thank CaoYi for helping me creat my assignments page.


## [Assignment_1](https://github.com/ChenXi19/hello-world/blob/master/README.md)
---
Since there is no requirements for the first homework, I just tried out some ways to put down things.And things are far
more interesting than I thought.

* Abstract <br>
This assignment is a display of several codings of different deepth-which use ASCII to show letters on the screen.
* Background Information <br>
ASCII abreviated form American Standard Code for Information Interchange, is a character-encoding scheme to represent text in computers, communication equipment, and other devices that use text. Originally based on the Englishalphabet, ASCII encodes 128 specified characters into seven-bit integers, consisting only 0 and 1. The characters encoded are numbers from 0 to 9, lowercase letters from a to z, uppercase letters from A to Z, basic punctuation symbols and space. ([More information on ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII))
* Details of This Assignment <br>
  * Step one: In this step, I managed to show a single letter on the screen.
  * Step two: Words of various length can be showed on the screen in the second step and a raw place where people can type in is added to the code. <br>

* Acknowledgement <br>
In finishing this assignment, I would like to express my gratitude to my classmate CaoYi who explanded the codings to me and taught me how to write them step by step. Furthermore, I also want to thank Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia for information on ASCII.
