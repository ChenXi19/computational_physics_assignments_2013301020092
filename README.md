>Since it is the first time that I get in touch with computer in a real sense, I imagine it is going to be really hard.
And I hope that after this semester I can be a little bit better at using my computer rather than simply use it to watch films. 
So that is the plan and good luck with myself.<br>

more interesting than I thought.
