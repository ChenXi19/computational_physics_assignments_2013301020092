# Assignment_10 THE LORENZ MODEL
student name: CHEN XI<br>
student number: 2013301020092

## Abstract 
In this assignment, a brief introduction of the Lorenz system will be given. Also as is required by Problem3.16, we will construct different phase-space plots in this assignment.

## Introduction
* The Lorenz system<br>
  The Lorenz system is a system of ordinary differential equations (the Lorenz equations, note it is not Lorentz) first studied by Edward Lorenz. It is notable for having chaotic solutions for certain parameter values and initial conditions. In particular, the Lorenz attractor is a set of chaotic solutions of the Lorenz system which, when plotted, resemble a butterfly or the figure one.
