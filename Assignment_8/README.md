## Abstract 
In this assignment we discuss two problems: One is the motion of the linear forced pendulum with friction and the other is the nonlinear pendulum and the relationship between the amplitude and the period. The modle concerned is a simple pendulum which is a particle of mass m connected to a massless string to a rigid support. The method used to solve for the equations of motion is Euler-Cromer method. In this assignment the effectiveness of Euler_Cromer method comparing to Euler method is also discussed.


## Introduction
* Simple pendulum
  A simple pendulum is a particle of mass m connected by a massless string to a rigid support. As in figure_1, there are only two forces acting on the partcle, gravity and the tension of the string. It is convinient to consider the components of these forces parallel and perpendicular to the string. The parrallel forces add to zero while the forces perpendicular to the string is given by:<br>
